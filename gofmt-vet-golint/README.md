This is a sample project to demostrate how to use vet/fmt/golint with [Gogradle](https://github.com/blindpirate/gogradle). 

No need to install `Go` or set `GOPATH` at all. Just install [JRE 8+](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) and run 

```
./gradlew build 
```
on POSIX or

```
gradlew build 
```
on Windows and see what happened!
